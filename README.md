# Covid-19 tracker

### An opensource project for Covid-19 tracker



I created this open source project using PHP for Coronavirus pandemic tracker.  

This project tracks the Confirmed, Recovered and Deaths of many major countries.
This project used third party API from John Hopkins University data.Apart from PHP it also uses HTML, CSS .



I have deployed this app on heroku.
